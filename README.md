# Know Your Congress

## Know your congressperson, Know your congress, Know the votes

Elisabeth, Brooke, Tyler, and JackieOur team was interested in the congresspeople that represent each of us, and in helping Americans get to know their congressperson and who they are.
We want to make this data exciting and easily accessible through an interactive dashboard.  We will use data from https://projects.propublica.org/api-docs/congress-api/
This includes all the data we will use in our dashboard.

>Know your Congress: See information on the 115th congress and their makeup: male to female ratio, length of time in congress, or how often votes are missed.

>Know your Congressperson: Hover over your hometown and see who represents you and links to their website, social media, and information on them- how long they’ve been in congress, bills they’ve sponsored, and how they voted- against and with their party, or not at all.

>Know the votes:  Choose a bill from a dropdown and see demographic information on who voted for the bill, who sponsored it, and who skipped the vote.
